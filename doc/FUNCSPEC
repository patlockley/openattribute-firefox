Functional and UI specification
-------------------------------

Any software is made to provide ways to solve a specific problem of its end user. The "end user" is not straightly meant to be a person, but in most cases she is. So, in case of application software, the specification of functionality may be done by listing the ways the software may solve its user`s problems. In case of a browser extension, these ways are cnnected to the UI the user sees. So, lets summarize what UI elements the extension should provide:

+ The icon placed in the location bar
	+ The icon image should refer to CC and reflect the extension`s purpose
	+ The icon should only be displayed if there`re any licensed objects
	+ The icon should be clickable, providing extended information about objects
	+ The icon should have a tooltip, indicating the number of licensed objects
	- The icon should have a context menu (be right-clickable)
		- The context menu should provide a way to navigate to extended information about licensed objects
		- The context menu should provide a way to highlight licensed objects
+ The tab in the "Page Info" dialog
	+ The tab image should also refer to CC and reflect the extension`s purpose
	± There should be a checkbox to turn the highlighting on/off
	+ There should be a label showing the number of all licensed objects
	+ There should be a list displaying an entry for any of licensed objects
		+ The name of the object should be displayed
		± Some information about the object should be shown:
			+ The type of the object
			+ The information about object`s creator
			- The information about object`s rights holder
			+ The hyperlink to the soure
		± Some licensing information should be shown:
			+ The name of the license
			- Standard СС icon(s)
			+ Hyperlink to the extended information about the license
			+ The summary of permissions, requirements and prohibitions
			+ The way to obtain the attribution information (a context menu-enabled button)
- Licensed objects` highlighting

Here "+" marks already implemented features, "±" — partly implemented, "-" — unimplemented. This list is the subject for updates during the development period.

On the other hand, there`re the other criteria to be used for functional specification, primarily for technical specialists who`re more familiar with the domain. Due to the fact that the extension is the interface between markup languages used to bring web-pages (or, more specifically, embedded RDFa markup) and a human being, the criterion may be the following: list the elements in the markup that are perceived by the extension.

The extension may use information defined by:
	+ http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#
		+ copyright
		+ license
	+ http://creativecommons.org/ns#
		+ Reproduction
        + Distribution
        + DerivativeWorks
        + HighIncomeNationUse
        + Sharing
		+ Notice
		+ Attribution
		+ ShareAlike
		+ SourceCode
		+ Copyleft
		+ LesserCopyleft
		+ CommercialUse
		+ attributionName
		+ attributionURL
	- http://purl.org/dc/terms/
		+ title
		+ type
	- http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/#

Currently the development process is focused on supporting more predcates from the list above, that would also lead to changing "-"/"±"s in the UI list to "+"s.
